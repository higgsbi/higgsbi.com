            <h1>Software Stack</h1>
            <p>
            I use a lot of software. I try to keep it all as lightweight as possible.
            Some of I made. Some of it other wonderful people made. Here's some of it:
            </p>
            <h2>Environment</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Operating System: <a href=https://fedoraproject.org/>fedora linux</a></li>
                    <li>Window Manager: <a href=https://swaywm.org/>sway</a></li>

                    <li>Image Viewer: <a href=https://github.com/derf/feh>feh</a></li>
                    <li>Clipboard: <a href=https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard>wl-clipboard</a></li>
                    <li>Launcher: <a href=https://github.com/philj56/tofi>tofi</a></li>

                    <li>Brightness/Audio Controls: <a href=https://github.com/higgsbi/simplecontrols>simplecontrols</a></li>

                    <li>Networking: <a href=https://docs.rockylinux.org/gemstones/network/nmtui/>nmtui</a></li>
                </ul>
                My system runs from sway to foot to tmux. Everything is launched into its own full screen workspace, or handled right in a 
                tmux panel. Because of this, most everything is a cli tool (more often than not, my own), 
                with the exception of some of my "fun apps" which are usually better suited to a large graphical program.

                </p>
            </p>
            <h2>Fun Things</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser: <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/>firefox</a></li>
                    <li>YouTube Videos With Family: <a href=https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube/>freetube</a></li>
                    <li>Personal YouTube Videos: <a href=https://github.com/Benexl/yt-x>yt-x</a></li>
                    <li>Archived Videos: <a href=https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv>mpv</a></li>
                </ul>
                I try to keep off of social media entirely, but I do like to keep up to date with some Linux projects on Reddit so I use 
                <a href=https://gitlab.com/aaronNG/reddio>reddio</a> to avoid actually opening up Reddit online.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ideally, I would use MPV for everything, but FreeTube is unreasonably convenient if anyone else is using my device, so electron is tolerated.<br> ¯\_( ツ)_/¯
            </p>            
            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Editor: <a href=https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/>helix</a></li>
                    <li>Multiplexer: <a href=https://github.com/tmux/tmux>tmux</a></li>
                    <li>Languages: rust, c, html, and css</li>
                    <li>Shell: dash for scripts, bash for interactive environment</li>
                </ul>
                My programming philsophy is always to keep it as efficient as possible. I've spent hundreds of hours in the higher of higher end languages
                such as Java, Kotlin, PHP, JS, and Swift, but for my personal projects, Rust, C, POSIX shell, HTML, and CSS are all that is necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary thought process in software/language choice is to opt for something that can run on a computer from 1990, but with the power of
                my modern hardware. I understand developer time is a consideration, but it seems odd to wrap everything in Electron and write in JS with 40
                libraries when languages like Rust allow for efficiency with the all the bells and whistles.
            </p>

            Helix is a fantastic little program. It is faster than both neovim and vim, and features every plugin I might want integrated
            automatically without any plugin loading system. If vim could keep up in speed, I would gladly bring it back, but it is currently not able
            to handle large files as well as Helix.
