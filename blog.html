        <h1>Blog</h1>
        <p>
        Historically, I have used more modern platforms for sharing thoughts, but these considering these
        sites are predatory, addicting, all consuming monstrosities, I am not a fan. These being your usual suspects: Instagram, Facebook,
        Reddit, and the like.
        </p>
        <p>
        After I stopped using these platforms, I naively tried "better" alternatives in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse>Fediverse</a>.
        Unfortunately, while these websites are slimmer and feature a better person to bot ratio, they are still not featuring 
        inspiring displays of human connection and quality information sharing that I want.
        At this point, I am of the opionion there are three ideal forms of communication (in descending order of quality):
        <ol>
            <li>Person to person, <em>preferably</em> surrounded by nature</li>
            <li>Video call</li>
            <li>Email, essay response, or other personal and long form messaging software</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        This page is an optimistic pursuit of communication method #3. I love reading genuine thoughts
        of other people on their own blogs, and wish to enjoy the simplistic design of the early internet. So here we are. If you want
        to read my thoughts, feel free. If you want to comment, question, or explain how silly I am, use my <a href="mailto:contact@higgsbi.com">email</a>.
        I try to respond when I can.

        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>
        The infrastructure for this blog is purposefully as simple as possible: plain html and some css, written by hand. I had created a markdown to html generator
        a while back with <a href=https://pandoc.org/>pandoc</a> and a nice Javascript UI, but that did not really seem to save any time. 
        In fact, I spent more time tinkering with it than actually writing anything. Writing HTML is not hard and gives remarkable flexibility, 
        so I will continue with that.<br>
